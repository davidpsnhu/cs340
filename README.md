When I write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I think it's helpful to use a modular approach. Rather than creating a single block of code with all the functions, classes, and main, it's better to organize files into classes, with associated getter and setter functions. Main should be in its own file, and helper functions can be in libraries. This approach allows individual libraries to be tweaked or fixed, with any code importing them benefiting from those changes.

As a computer science student, I typically take a top-down, requirements-driven approach to problem-solving. For example, when working on Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard requirements, I started by considering the overall picture of what needed to be built, rather than diving straight into coding individual components. This differs from the bottom-up approach I've used in previous assignments, which can lead to a lot of re-work as functions develop.

To create databases that meet client requests in the future, I would continue to use a top-down approach, and consider factors such as scalability, security, and performance. I would also prioritize creating a clear and consistent data model, and using efficient query optimization techniques to ensure the database performs well as it grows in size.
